# 🏺 Archaeology Mapping Platform

A web-based platform for crowdsourced reporting and preliminary analysis of potential archaeological findings.

## 📌 About the Project
Many archaeological objects are lost due to the lack of a simple and accessible way to report discoveries. People may encounter fragments of pottery, metal objects, or other artifacts but often do not know how or where to report them.  
This project addresses that gap by providing a **digital platform** where citizens can mark potential findings on an interactive map, while archaeologists and researchers can review, verify, and systematize the collected data.

## 🎯 Goal
To create a centralized system that:
- preserves cultural and historical heritage  
- engages the public in archaeological research  
- improves communication between citizens and professionals  

## ⚙️ Core Features
- 🗺️ Interactive map for adding and viewing findings  
- 📍 Automatic geolocation detection  
- 📸 Photo upload and detailed descriptions  
- 👤 User dashboard with submission history  
- 🧑‍🔬 Expert panel for review and moderation  
- 📊 Submission status tracking (under review / rejected / promising)  
- 🛡️ Protection against fake or duplicate reports  

## 🧠 Technical Concept
The platform serves as a **tool for initial documentation and analysis** of potential archaeological sites.  
Optional hardware modules (e.g., Arduino-based controllers connected to sensors) may assist in detecting **soil or magnetic anomalies**, but they do not replace professional archaeological methods or expertise.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React / Next.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js (NestJS) or Django  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + PostGIS  
- **Maps:** Mapbox / OpenStreetMap  
- **Authentication:** JWT / OAuth  

## 🚀 Future Development
- AI-based image analysis of reported findings  
- Risk mapping of illegal excavations  
- Integration with museums and universities  
- Mobile application  
- Advanced regional analytics  

## 🤝 Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or suggest improvements.  
The project is open to collaboration with developers, researchers, and educational institutions.
